# G-Hub_GameStoreApplication

The gaming industry has seen a huge upheaval in popularity. They are becoming 
an integral part of a common manâ€™s life. Gaming industry is larger than
both the box office and music industry combined!
Game stores can be found almost anywhere, putting out games and consoles for people to experience and buy. 
With the emergence of online game stores, my team and I decided to come up 
with our own version of a game store, providing an interface not just for the game 
buyer, but also for the store manager or a game developer. Our aim was to 
create a code to simulate environments for all such needs and purposes.
Our code uses a variety of user defined functions and builds a multi-end Game Store Application that caters
to fulfil all the requirements for all stakeholders in the console gaming industry. 

(Store Managers/Admins, Developers/Companies and Customers)


Python and MySQL have been used in this project. I made this project as a part of my senior year CS project!
