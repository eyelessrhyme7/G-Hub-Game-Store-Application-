# G-Hub_GameStoreApplication

The gaming industry has seen a huge upheaval in popularity. They are becoming 
an integral part of a common manâ€™s life. Game stores can be found almost 
anywhere, putting out games and consoles for people to experience and buy. 
With the emergence of online game stores, my team and I decided to come up 
with our own version of a game store, providing an interface not just for the game 
buyer, but also for the store manager or a game developer. Our aim was to 
create a code to simulate environments for all such needs and purposes.
Our code uses a variety of user defined functions to fulfil all the requirements for 
the game store simulator. 

We have also implemented new concepts that we learnt in grade 12 like using 
MySQL to store data and accessing them with the use of the MySQL Connector 
module. Most of our data is stored in multiple tables and is presented to the user 
at the time of request in a clean, readable format.
